Hey fellow data enthusiasts! 👋  

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I dived into time series forecasting using Facebook's Prophet library to predict Microsoft's closing stock prices. 📊 This project covers everything from data collection and feature engineering to model implementation and evaluation.

Key Highlights:

📅 Utilized Yahoo Finance for historical Microsoft (MSFT) closing price data from 2003-2023.
🛠 Engineered time series features and visualized insights with Seaborn.
🔄 Split data into train/test sets, fitting a robust Prophet model on the training data.
📉 Evaluated model performance with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.
📊 Achieved accurate forecasts, even incorporating US federal holidays.
🔍 Future Exploration:
I'm eager to explore more in the realm of time series forecasting! If you have suggestions, or insights, or want to collaborate, feel free to jump in.
